# GitHub Commit Bot

## Description

This is a simple Python CLI bot that creates a loop, then automatically creates a log file and writes to it, adds and commits the changes, and finally pushes the commit to a remote GitHub repository. This loop will make as many commits as you want, simply change the value of 'max_loop'.

The reason why I created this bot was because I wanted my GitHub history to show commits being made everyday. Finding time to make commits every single day can be sometimes difficult, and this bot solves this issue. Now my GitHub history shows hundreds of commits being made everyday, and I don't have to manually make them if I don't want to. 

**That's the beauty of learning a skill like automation scripting: you don't have to manually do something you don't feel like doing 😉**

## Usage

Install the required packages from 'requirements.txt', then run 'git_bot.py'.
Note that you will need to change certain fields in 'git_bot.py' to match your GitHub account, and you will need to make sure that the '.git' folder you're using on your local machine is properly configured, otherwise this script will not work correctly.
