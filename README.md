# Python Commit Bot for GitHub

## Description

This is a simple Python CLI bot that creates a loop, then automatically creates a log file and writes to it, adds and commits the changes, and finally pushes the commit to a remote GitHub repository. This loop will make as many commits as you want, simply change the value of 'max_loop'.

The reason why I created this bot was because I wanted my GitHub history to show commits being made everyday. Finding time to make commits every single day can be sometimes difficult, and this bot solves this issue. Now my GitHub history shows hundreds of commits being made everyday, and I don't have to manually make them if I don't want to.
